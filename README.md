# Data Cleaning
Found median year and removed all cars before then
Found no null values

# Define the research question:
Are American cars  faster than Japanese cars on average past the median year?
# Formulate null and alternative hypotheses:
H0 = American cars are not faster than Japanese cars
Ha = American cars are faster than Japanese cars
# Choose a significance level (a):
Declared our alpha as the standard of .05
# Select an appropriate test statistic
We will be using the Independent T Test
# Collect data:
Given to us.

# Calculate the test statistic: 
Test Stat: -1.017
Leaning more toward the null hypothesis

# Determine the p-value: 
p-value: 0.8445711798616594
Suggests high probability due to chance.

# Compare the p-value to Î±:
p-value > a
We cannot reject the null hypothesis.

# Draw conclusions: 
According to the data, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of US vehicles not being faster than Japanese cars made past the median year.
Refer to graphs.

# Consider effect size and practical significance: 
Effect size: -0.17331959628141816
This shows that it has a negligible effect size, which means it has limited practical application. This is due to our smaller sample size. Possibly measuring MPG could have a greater effect size.

# Assess statistical power:
Statistical power shows that we have a higher chance of encountering a Type II error. However, our effect size and sample size lend themselves to this metric within the context of our experiment.
