# Data Ckeaning
Found median year and removed all cars before then
Found no null values

# Define the research question:
Are American cars  faster than Japanese cars on average past the median year?
# Formulate null and alternative hypothesis:
H0 = American cars are not faster than Japanese cars
Ha = American cars are faster than Japanese cars
# Choose a significance level (a):
Declared our alpha as the standard of .05
# Select an appropriate test statistic
We will be using the Independent T Test
# Collect data:

# Calculate the test statistic: 
Test Stat: -1.017
Leaning more towards the null hypothesis

# Determine the p-value: 
p-value: 0.8445711798616594
Suggests high probability due to chance
# Compare the p-value to Î±:
p-value > a
We cannot reject the null hypothesis
# Draw conclusions: 
According to data, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of US vehicles not being faster than Japanese cars made past the median year.
Refer to graphs.
# Consider effect size and practical significance: 
Effect size: -0.17331959628141816
This shows that it has a small effect size which means it has a limited practical application. This due to our smaller sample size. Possibly measuring MPG could have a greater effect size
